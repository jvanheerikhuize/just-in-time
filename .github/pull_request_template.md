## For Spec Implementations

When implementing a specification:
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria MUST be implemented
2. ✅ Tests MUST cover each acceptance criterion
3. ✅ Spec status will be updated to 'implemented' after merge
4. ✅ Any deviations from spec must be documented and approved

## For AI-Generated PRs

If this PR was generated by Claude Code:
1. Human review is still required
2. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
3. Check for any edge cases not covered
4. Ensure code follows project patterns
