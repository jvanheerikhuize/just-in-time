custom_instructions: |
  When working on this codebase:
  1. Read .ai/CONTEXT.md first for project overview
  2. Follow patterns in .ai/architecture/PATTERNS.md
  3. No build steps, no frameworks, no npm runtime dependencies
  4. All content goes in data/ files as JS objects
  5. Write Infocom-style humor for all game text
